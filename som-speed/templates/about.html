<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>The SOM VM Speed Center gives an overview of the performance of the different SOM implementations.</p>
<p>The goal is to compare the effiency reached by different implementation techniques for programming language
implementation. Currently, we compare classic interpreter techniques used for CSOM and SOM++ with advanced
approaches such as metatracing used for RPySOM and self-optimizing interpreters used for TruffleSOM.</p>
<p>This site runs on top of Django and Codespeed</p>
<h3>About the benchmarks</h3>
<p>The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/SOM-st/SOM/tree/master/Examples/Benchmarks">here</a>.</p>
